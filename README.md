# Things that are still unclear for me:

* Why people are using Scala instead of Java or Kotlin ?
* What problems do Scala solves ?
* How compilers do know what type is used ? (Course doesnt explain this question in detail)
* How Scala types Hierarchy structured ? 
* In which cases it's better to use regular class rather than case class ?
* Tail recursion of mutual tail recursive function calls ?

# Answered questions

* #### Is method overloading is OK when we have default params and by name substitution ?
##### it's seems like overriding is ok, but when it comes to overloading we face with problems. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2510108/why-avoid-method-overloading
* #### Tail recursion of mutual tail recursive function calls ?
##### tail recursive calls works on only on self-calling tail recursive functions.
